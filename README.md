# Credit_card_fraud-_detection
This project uses Machine Learning Algorithms to classify credit card fraud or not in a dataset 
Logistic Regression was evaluated alongside SVM algorithm
Grid Search from SKlearn was used to identify the best parameter for the best performance of the algorithm
Model Performances was evaluated using F1 score, Accuracy, AUC/ROC, classification report was also plotted.
